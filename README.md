### Authentic London
-------
Authentic London is a site for a walking tour company that aims to give the user a very local experience by using guides who live in and local to the area of the tour. This is to give the user the best unique experience to each tour area, the guides knowledge from being a local creates an experience that is uniquely immersive. 

The objective is to provide tours that go off the tourist trail, we leave behind all the big tourist regulars people are accustom to and enter into the cultural heart and soul of London exploring the otherwise unseen parts. 

These tours are aimed at tourists who have been to London before and are looking for things to do away from the main tourist hot spots, they are also aimed at Londoners who want to explore more of their home and new residents alike.
